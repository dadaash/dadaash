ðŸ‘‹ Hi guys!<br/>Iâ€™m dadaash. This name was formed by joining my son name "ash" and my name "dada" is how he calls me.

I have been in the software industry for 10+ years working as a software engineer involving 
design and analysis, code implementation and functional test creation and execution, providing 
support in system test production and customer faults and issues.

I just started to work on some opensource projects involving some well-known software programming languages.
I look forward to being involved in collaborations which I believe could really help me with this journey.
