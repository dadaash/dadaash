ðŸ‘‹ Hi guys!<br/>Iâ€™m Yco. I am a programmer.

I have been in the software industry for 10+ years working as a software engineer involving 
design and analysis, code implementation and functional test creation and execution, providing 
support in production test and customer live enviroment.

I just started to work on some opensource projects involving some well-known software programming languages.
I look forward to being involved in collaborations which I believe could really help me with this journey.
